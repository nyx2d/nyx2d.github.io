    <h2 id="post-title">explorations in p2p development</h2>
    <span id="date">[2023-08-19]</span>

    <p>
        this post is a work in progress. please note that in code snippets I have removed error handling for the sake of
        brevity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have long known that I'm a tactile learner when it comes to software.
        I never feel like I truly understand something until I've built (or attempted to build) a prototype or proof of
        concept. at this point in my programming career, I probably have hundreds of unfinished projects on my drive.
        completion is never the point - I do enough to get some critical concepts to stick and then move on.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been fascinated by p2p technology for a long time. within the last few years I've been
        keeping my eye on several cool projects, especially things like
        <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/" target="_blank">ssb</a>,
        <a href="https://earthstar-project.org/" target="_blank">earthstar</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/hypercore-protocol" target="_blank">hypercore</a>, and
        <a href="https://p2panda.org/" target="_blank">p2panda</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've hacked on a number of p2p adjacent things over the years, including a (very) small social network that
        works over WebRTC and uses public/private key pairs for identity. still, I had never really gotten my hands
        dirty with lower level implementations. this is a quick and dirty log of my process doing that.
    </p>

    <h2>a toy network</h2>

    <p2>
        I decided to write my experimental network in Go, since I'm pretty comfortable in it. first things first, I
        decided on using <a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/" target="_blank">ed25519</a> key pairs
        for identity on the network. this is, unsurprisingly, the same thing ssb uses. Go also includes "crypto/ed25519"
        in the standard library.
    </p2>

    <p> for legible IDs I decided on a simple base64 encoding.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
pubKey, privateKey, _ := ed25519.GenerateKey(rand.Reader)
peerID := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(pubKey)    
    </code></pre>

    <h2>peer discovery</h2>

    <p>
        next up was local peer discovery. I considered a few options here,
        including rolling my own UDP broadcast based system, but ultimately
        decided to use mDNS alongside DNS-SD. as it turns out, this is also <a
            href="https://gwil.garden/posts/es_update_04_23" target="_blank">the approach earthstar is working on</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        there's already a <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/mdns" target="_blank">great go library by hashicorp</a>
        focused on this exact use-case (mDNS+DNS-SD). it was very easy to setup service advertising.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
func Broadcast(peerID string, servicePort int) {
    service, _ := mdns.NewMDNSService(peerID, "my_network", "", "", servicePort, nil, []string{peerID})
    server, _ := mdns.NewServer(&mdns.Config{Zone: service}) // kicks off goroutine in constructor
    log.Printf("broadcasting as peer %s\n", peerID)
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        to enable discovery on the other end, I wrote a simple function that preforms an mDNS query every few seconds.
        I spawn a goroutine to run this indefinitely.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
const period = 10 * time.Second
const timeout = 2 * time.Second
const bufferSize = 256

func FindPeers(peerID string) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(period)
    for ; true; <-ticker.C {
        entriesChan := make(chan *mdns.ServiceEntry, bufferSize)
        mdns.Query(&mdns.QueryParam{Service: serviceName, Domain: "local", Timeout: timeout, Entries: entriesChan, DisableIPv6: true})
        entries, _, _, _ := lo.BufferWithTimeout(entriesChan, bufferSize, timeout)
        for _, entry := range entries {
            addr := &net.TCPAddr{IP: entry.AddrV4, Port: entry.Port}
            if entry.Info != peerID {
                // handle newly discovered peer
            }
        }
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>I know there's probably a cleaner way to write this logic but hey, it works</p>

    <h2>peer to peer communication</h2>

    <p>
        after discovery, my next step was deciding on the actual communication protocol. I considered a few options,
        including rolling something from scratch using UDP (to more easily support NAT traversal). ultimately I decided
        to just use <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC</a>, as it's very well established and supports
        <a href="https://protobuf.dev/" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        setting up a grpc server is very straightforward. you first need to define a protobuf file that defines the RPC
        interface. you then run the protobuf code generator, which outputs Go.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-protobuf">
message Message {
    oneof content {
        SignedMessage signed_message = 1;
    }
}

service Network {
    rpc Gossip(stream Message) returns (stream Message);
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        you then need to implement the server interface. I decided to use a single rpc call with bidirectional
        streaming in an attempt to dissolve the distinction between client and server gRPC implicitly has.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
type server struct {
    pb.UnimplementedNetworkServer
}

func (s *server) Gossip(stream pb.Network_GossipServer) error {
    for {
        val, err := stream.Recv()
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }
        // handle message
    }
    return nil
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        to actually register your server instance, you need to bind it to a TCP socket. this is also where we get
        auto assigned port info to pass to our earlier broadcast function.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">
func Serve(peerID string) int {
    lis, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":0")
    pb.RegisterNetworkServer(grpc.NewServer(), &server{})
    go func() {
        log.Printf("gRPC server listening at %v", lis.Addr())
        s.Serve(lis)
    }()
    return lis.Addr().(*net.TCPAddr).Port, nil
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>authentication</h2>

    <p>
        while we know what peerID a node is advertising as from their DNS-SD Info data, we don't currently have any way
        to validate that,
        nor ensure that the traffic we're receiving hasn't been tampered with by a man in the middle attack.
    </p>

    <p>
        so to address this I decided to tackle authentication. <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/"
            target="_blank">gRPC supports a few
            authentication schemes</a>, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
            target="_blank">TLS</a>. unfortunately, gRPC's implementation only supports the standard x.509 certificate
        scheme, which usually comes with the implication of a centralized certificate authority.
    </p>

    <p>
        I decided to leverage self-signed certificates using the peer's ed25519 keys instead
    </p>

    <p>
        another solution is to convert the peer's ed25519 key into x25519 key (following <a
            href="https://words.filippo.io/using-ed25519-keys-for-encryption/" target="_blank"></a>something like this
        blog post and <a href="github.com/teserakt-io/golang-ed25519/extra25519" target="_blank">this library</a>). the
        x25519 key can then be used with the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/ecdh" target="_blank">crypto/ecdh</a>
        package to generate a shared secret that can be used to encrypt traffic.
